Location information is becoming increasingly popular in online social networks, vehicle networks, and online games. In this paper, we develop a distributed protocol that allows one party to determine, in a private and secure manner, whether or not the trajectory of a second party has an intersection with the first party. Our design is fully flexible, meaning that each user is able to specify what kind of datasets they would like to make visible, and be queried by other users. The methodology is based on developing a generalized set membership check approach, where our design is based on an advanced data structure called the bloom filter. Our work, to our knowledge, is the first to propose a homomorphic version of this data structure.  To demonstrate its feasibility, we offer a working prototype, which is implemented on the open-source homomorphic libraries. Our preliminary results demonstrate the performance and overhead of the proposed approach as well as the security of the protocol designs.
