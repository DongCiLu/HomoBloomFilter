\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we investigate the problem on how to keep users' location data secure, while at the same time allowing servers to perform basic operations on the data. We demonstrated secure computation primitives on location data where the servers should have no knowledge on the plaintext, i.e., the servers should not even keep the private keys to decrypt data. In this way, compromised servers will not cause leaked user data. Our work is built on the recently developed homomorphic computing principles, and developed a generalized secure set membership check framework based on an advanced data structure called the bloom filter. Our work, to our knowledge, is the first to propose a homomorphic version of this data structure. Finally, we also evaluated a working prototype, which is implemented on the open-source homomorphic libraries. Our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach as well as the security of the protocol designs.
